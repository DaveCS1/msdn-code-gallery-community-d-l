HISTORY of the Ghostscript.NET library

1.0.7.         2013-09-17
-------------------------
- implemented multi-page PostScript support for the GhostscriptViewer.
- included Microsoft.WinAny.Helper code files in order to have a single dll for the 
  deployment. This will leave Ghostscript.NET library without any extra dependencies.
- added Processing event to the GhostscriptProcessor class. Processing event contains
  TotalPages and CurrentPage information.
- added Error event in the GhostscriptProcessor class. Raised when error occures in
  the Ghostscript interpreter.
- added DisplayPdfSample into the Ghostscript.NET.Samples project.

1.0.6.         2013-09-03
-------------------------
- added zoom-in and zoom-out functionality
- fixed ImageMemoryHelper.Set24bppRgbImageColor function when stride size is not
  multiple of 3 bytes
- fixed displayed page size

1.0.5.         2013-09-02
-------------------------
- implemented progressive display update while ghostscript is drawing / rasterizing,
  now a custom update interval can be set in GhostscriptViewer class.
- fixed problem when using 64-bit ghostscript library where raster (stride) line 
  size is not equal to 32-bit ghostscript library raster line size.
- changed GhostscriptViewer class event logic.
- changed Ghostscript.NET.Viewer application in order to show progressive update.
- modified Ghostscript.NET.DisplayTest, now it uses GhostscriptViewer class with 
  ability to interpret postscript and display standard input output messages.

1.0.4.         2013-08-30
-------------------------
- fixed display_device callback for 64-bit systems, now this library is compatibile
  with both 32-bit and 64-bit version of Ghostscript interpreter.
- added GhostscriptViewer Postscript file handler.

1.0.3.         2013-08-28
-------------------------
- fixed GhostscriptInterpreter.Run string limit, strings larger than 64 kb are now 
  supported.
- added GhostscriptViewer* classes which allows you to render and navigate through 
  PDF file on the screen.
- Ghostscript.NET.Viewer project added to shows how simple GhostscriptViewer class 
  implementation is.

1.0.2.         2013-08-26
-------------------------
- added GhostscriptInterpreter class with StdIO and Display callbacks. This class can
  run postscript from the memory and display raster result from the memory on to the
  screen.
- added Ghostscript.NET.DisplayTest sample with GhostscriptInterpreter class implemented.
- changed Ghostscript.NET.Samples logic to make samples run easier.
- fixed GetInstalledVersion method to search for both GPL and AFPL versions also
  making sure it returns only x86 or x64 ones based on running process.

1.0.1.         2013-08-26
-------------------------
- implementation logic is changed
- added GhostscriptProcessor class with StdIO which allows you to process the files
  by defining init arguments only with ability to handle Ghostscrtip output messages.


1.0.0.         2013-08-22
-------------------------
- initial release, all ghostscript functions are implemented and base wrapper created.
- ability to run multiple instances of the Ghostscript within a single process.
