    3. Game of Fifteen
    4. Mystic Square and many others) is a sliding puzzle
    
    Description: 15 of the 16 positions in a 4*4 matrix are filled by tiles, leaving one unfilled hole. Tiles adjoining the hole can be shifted into the hole, the object being to form some particular permutation of the tiles (typically forming a picture out of fragments printed on the tiles). 
    Status: this is a finite problem, but can easily be generalized to n*n matrices. Testing whether a solution exists is in P but finding the solution with the fewest moves is NP-complete.
