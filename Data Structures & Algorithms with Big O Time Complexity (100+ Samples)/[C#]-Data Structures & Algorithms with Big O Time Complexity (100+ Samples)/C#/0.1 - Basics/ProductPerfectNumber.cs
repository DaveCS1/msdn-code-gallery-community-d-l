    If the product of all its divisors, other than itself, is equal to the number. 

    E.g. 10 and 21 are product perfect numbers since 1 X 2 X 5 = 10 and 1 X 3 X 7 = 21, whereas 25 is not.
    1, 2, 5 are divisors of 10 and if we calculate the product (multiplication) of all these numbers which is equals to the actual number i.e. 10.
    Same way for 21. 

    For 25 the divisors are 1,5 and their product (1 X 5) is not equals to 25.
