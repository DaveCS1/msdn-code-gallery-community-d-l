    A Judy array is a data structure that has high performance, low memory usage and implements an associative array. 
    Unlike normal arrays, Judy arrays may be sparse, that is, they may have large ranges of unassigned indices. 
    They can be used for storing and looking up values using integer or string keys. 
    The key benefits of using a Judy array is its scalability, high performance, memory efficiency and ease of use
    Drawbacks: The HP (SourceForge) implementation of Judy arrays appears to be the subject of US patent 6735595
