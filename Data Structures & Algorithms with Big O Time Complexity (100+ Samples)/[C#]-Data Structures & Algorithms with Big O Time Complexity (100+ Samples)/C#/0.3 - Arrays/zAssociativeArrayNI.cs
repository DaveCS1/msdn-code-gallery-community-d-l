    /*
     Associative array, map, symbol table, or dictionary is an abstract data type composed of a collection of (key, value) pairs, such that each possible key appears at most once in the collection.
     
     Operations associated with this data type:
     
         * the addition of pairs to the collection
         * the removal of pairs from the collection
         * the modification of the values of existing pairs
         * the lookup of the value associated with a particular key

    An e.g. By using hash table we can implement associative arrays.
    Refer Hash table example (work in progress) in 7 - Searching Techniques
    
    A multimap (sometimes also multihash) is a generalization of a map or associative array abstract data type in which more than one value may be associated with and returned for a given key.
