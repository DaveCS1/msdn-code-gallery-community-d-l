    Linear Time - O (N)

    Is an optimization problem for finding closest (or most similar) points. 
    Closeness is typically expressed in terms of a dissimilarity function: The less similar are the objects the larger are the function values. 
    
    Defined as follows: 
    Given a set S of points in a space M and a query point q ∈ M, find the closest point in S to q. 

    Donald Knuth in vol. 3 of The Art of Computer Programming (1973) called it the Post-Office Problem, referring to an application of assigning to a residence the nearest post office. 
    A direct generalization of this problem is a k-NN search, where we need to find the k closest points.
