    Greedy algorithm:
    Is an algorithm that follows the problem solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum. 
    In many problems, a greedy strategy does not in general produce an optimal solution, but nonetheless a greedy heuristic may yield locally optimal solutions that approximate a global optimal solution in a reasonable time.

    Components:

    1. A candidate set:
       From which a solution is created
    
    2. A selection function:
       Which chooses the best candidate to be added to the solution
    
    3. A feasibility function:
       That is used to determine if a candidate can be used to contribute to a solution
    
    4. An objective function:
       Which assigns a value to a solution, or a partial solution
    
    5. A solution function:
       Which will indicate when we have discovered a complete solution
