    Online Algorithm is one that can process its input piece-by-piece in a serial fashion, i.e. in the order the input is fed to the algorithm
    without having the entire input available from the start. 

    Offline Algorithm is given the whole problem data from the beginning and is required to output an answer which solves the problem at hand.     
    E.g Selection sort requires that the entire list be given before it can sort it, while insertion sort doesn't.

    Insertion sort produces the optimum result, i.e., a correctly sorted list. 
    For many problems, online algorithms cannot match the performance of offline algorithms.

    The performance of an algorithm that operates on data streams is measured by three basic factors:
    1. The number of passes the algorithm must make over the stream.
    2. The available memory.
    3. The running time of the algorithm
