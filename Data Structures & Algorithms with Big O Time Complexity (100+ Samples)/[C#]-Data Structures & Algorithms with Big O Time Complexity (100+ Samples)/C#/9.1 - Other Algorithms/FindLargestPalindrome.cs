    Imagine we have a large string like this "ABCBAHELLOHOWRACECARAREYOUIAMAIDOINGGOOD" which contains multiple palindromes within it, like ABCBA, RACECAR, ARA, IAMAI etc... 
    Now write a method which will accept this large string and return the largest palindrome from this string. 
    If there are two palindromes which are of same size, it would be sufficient to just return any one of them.
