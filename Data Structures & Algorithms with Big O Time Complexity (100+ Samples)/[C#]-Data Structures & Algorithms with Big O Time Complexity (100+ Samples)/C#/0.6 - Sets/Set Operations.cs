    Examples:
    {1, 2} ∪ {1, 2} = {1, 2}.
    {1, 2, 3} ∪ {3, 4, 5} = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
    Some basic properties of unions:
    A ∪ B = B ∪ A.
    A ∪ (B ∪ C) = (A ∪ B) ∪ C.
    A ⊆ (A ∪ B).
    A ∪ A = A.
    A ∪ ∅ = A.
    A ⊆ B if and only if A ∪ B = B.
        Union        : {1, 2} ∪ {2, 3} = {1, 2, 3}.
        Intersection : {1, 2} ∩ {2, 3} = {2}.

    If every member of set A is also a member of set B, then A is said to be a subset of B, written A ⊆ B (also pronounced A is contained in B).
