    Dynamic sets[edit]

    Dynamic set structures typically add:
    create(): creates a new, initially empty set structure. create_with_capacity(n): creates a new set structure, initially empty but capable of holding up to n elements.

    add(S,x): adds the element x to S, if it is not present already.
    remove(S, x): removes the element x from S, if it is present.
    capacity(S): returns the maximum number of values that S can hold.

    Some set structures may allow only some of these operations. The cost of each operation will depend on the implementation, and possibly also on the particular values stored in the set, and the order in which they are inserted.
