    A disjoint-set data structure is a data structure that keeps track of a set of elements partitioned into a number of disjoint (nonoverlapping) subsets. 
    
    A Union-Find algorithm is an algorithm that performs two useful operations on such a data structure:

    1. Find     : Determine which subset a particular element is in. This can be used for determining if two elements are in the same subset.
    2. Union    : Join two subsets into a single subset.
