1. Statistics and other Decision Sciences

    Statistics is the study of the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data.

     which was originally conceived as the science of the state — the collection and analysis of facts about a country: its economy, land, military, population, and so forth. 
     Mathematical techniques which are used for this include mathematical analysis, linear algebra, stochastic analysis, differential equations, and measure-theoretic probability theory

   1.1. Descriptive Statistics - The part of statistics that describes data, i.e. Summarises the data and their typical properties.
   1.2. Inferential Statistics - The part of statistics that draws conclusions from data (using some model for the data).
   E.g. Inferential statistics involves selecting a model for the data, checking whether the data fulfill the conditions of a particular model, and with quantifying the involved uncertainty (e.g. using confidence intervals)
