1. Pure Mathematics:
2. Applied Mathematics

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Pure Mathematics:

Studies entirely abstract concepts. Is not necessarily applied mathematics.

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    1. Quantity (numbers):

        1. Natural numbers 
        2. Integers 
        3. Rational numbers 
        4. Real numbers 
        5. Complex numbers 

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    2. Structure:

        1. Combinatorics            Study of finite or countable discrete structures. Combinatorial problems arise in many areas of pure mathematics, notably in algebra, probability theory, topology, and geometry. 
        2. Number theory 
        3. Group theory             Studies the algebraic structures known as groups. 
                                    The concept of a group is central to abstract algebra: other well-known algebraic structures, such as rings, fields, and vector spaces can all be seen as groups endowed with additional operations and axioms
                                    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_theory
        4. Graph theory             Study of graphs, which are mathematical structures used to model pairwise relations between objects. 
                                    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory
        5. Order theory 
        6. Algebra                  Study of symbols and the rules for manipulating symbols. One of the broad parts of mathematics, together with number theory, geometry and analysis.
                                    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra
            1. Elementary Algebra   Basic concepts of algebra.
                                    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_algebra
            Exponents:
            1. a^1 = a, 
            2. a^0 = 1
            3. 2^6 = 64
            4. a^b X a^c =  a^b+c   The multiplication rule applies just to the product, not to the sum of two numbers.
            5. a^b + a^c <> a^b+c

            Scientific Notation :   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_notation

            Use a calculator to multiply these 2 numbers:
            60,000,000,000,000 x 20,000,000,000
            A short way of writing very long numbers called scientific notation, or E notation on a calculator ("E" stands for "Exponent"). 
            In scientific notation all numbers are written in the form
            a × 10^b
            350 can be written as 3.5 × 10^2 or 35 × 10^1 or 350 × 10^0.
            A number written in scientific notation is written as a product of a number between 1 and 10 and a power of 10.
            60,000,000,000,000 X 20,000,000,000 = 1.2e + 24

            6.022E23 or 6.022e23 is equivalent to 6.022×10^23, and 1.6×10^−35 would be written 1.6e-35 

            2. Linear Algebra       Concerning vector spaces and linear mappings between such spaces. 
                                    It includes the study of lines, planes, and subspaces, but is also concerned with properties common to all vector spaces.

            6. Homological Algebra  Studies homology in a general algebraic setting. 
                                    It is a relatively young discipline, whose origins can be traced to investigations in combinatorial topology (a precursor to algebraic topology) and abstract algebra (theory of modules and syzygies)

            8. Universal Algebra    Studies algebraic structures themselves, not examples ("models") of algebraic structures. 
                                    E.g. Rather than take particular groups as the object of study, in universal algebra one takes "the theory of groups" as an object of study.

Eg1. x - 2 = 4 
x - 2 + 2 = 4 +2
X + 0 = 6

Eg2. 4x = 8
4/4X = 8/4
x = 2

Eg3. X/3 = 5
X3(1/3) = 5 X 3

X/3 + 2 -2 = 5 -2
X/3 = 3
X 3(1/3) = 3 X 3
x = 9

Eg5.

Sam bought 3 boxes of chocolates online. 
Postage was $9 and the total cost was $45. 
How much was each box?

3x + 9 = 45
3x = 36
x = 12 

½(y - 6) = 7
y = 20

1. Exponents
2. Factoring
3. Logarithms

The idea of logarithms is to reverse the operation of exponentiation, i.e. raising a number to a power. 
E.g, the third power (or cube) of 2 is 8, because 8 is the product of three factors of 2:
2^3 = 2 x 2 x 2 = 8.

It follows that the logarithm of 8 with respect to base 2 is 3, so log2 8 = 3.

   Any 2 real numbers b and x where b is positive and b <> 1
   y = b^x 
   x = log b (y)
   logb(xy) = logb(x) + logb(y)
   3.1. Binary Logarithms - Base 2 Prominent in Computer Science.

Calculus :
Study of Change.
The fundamental theorem of calculus states that differentiation and integration are inverse operations.

1. Integral
2. Derivatives

Integral calculus is the study of the definitions, properties, and applications of two related concepts, the indefinite integral and the definite integral. The process of finding the value of an integral is called integration. In technical language, integral calculus studies two related linear operators.

The indefinite integral is the antiderivative, the inverse operation to the derivative. F is an indefinite integral of f when f is a derivative of F. (This use of lower- and upper-case letters for a function and its indefinite integral is common in calculus.)

The definite integral inputs a function and outputs a number, which gives the algebraic sum of areas between the graph of the input and the x-axis. The technical definition of the definite integral is the limit of a sum of areas of rectangles, called a Riemann sum.

A motivating example is the distances traveled in a given time.
\mathrm{Distance} = \mathrm{Speed} \cdot \mathrm{Time}
Integration is one of the two main operations in calculus, with its inverse, differentiation, being the other. 
Given a function f of a real variable x and an interval [a, b] of the real line, the definite integral
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derivative

The derivative of a function of a real variable measures the sensitivity to change of a quantity (a function or dependent variable) which is determined by another quantity (the independent variable). It is a fundamental tool of calculus. For example, the derivative of the position of a moving object with respect to time is the object's velocity: this measures how quickly the position of the object changes when time is advanced. The derivative measures the instantaneous rate of change of the function, as distinct from its average rate of change, and is defined as the limit of the average rate of change in the function as the length of the interval on which the average is computed tends to zero.
