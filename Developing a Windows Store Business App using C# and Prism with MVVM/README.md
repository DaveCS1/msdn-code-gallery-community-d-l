<h1><span>Introduction</span></h1>
<p>This AdventureWorks sample and Prism library helps developers who want to create Windows Store business apps using C#, XAML, the Windows Runtime and development practices such as Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) and event aggregation. The sample comes with the
 Prism library&nbsp;source code&nbsp;&nbsp;and associated documentation.&nbsp;The sample and documentation provide guidance on&nbsp;MVVM with navigation and app life cycle management, validation, management of app data,&nbsp;controls, acessibility,&nbsp;localization
 of&nbsp;pages, touch, search, tiles, and tile notifications. It also provide guidance on testing your app and tuning its performance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's what you'll learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to implement pages, controls, touch, navigation, settings, suspend/resume, search, tiles, and tile notifications.
</li><li>How to implement the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern with lifecycle management and navigation.
</li><li>How to validate user input for correctness. </li><li>How to manage application data. </li><li>How to test your app and tune its performance. </li></ul>

<h1><span>Building the Sample</span></h1>
<p>Build the AdventureWorks Shopper Microsoft Visual Studio solution as you would build a standard solution.</p>
<ol>
<li>On the Visual Studio&nbsp;menu bar, choose <strong>Build</strong> &gt; <strong>
Build Solution</strong>. </li><li>After you build the solution, you must deploy it. On the menu bar, choose <strong>
Build</strong> &gt; <strong>Deploy Solution</strong>. Visual Studio also deploys the project when you run the app from the debugger.
</li><li>After you deploy the project, you should run it. On the menu bar, choose <strong>
Debug</strong> &gt;&nbsp; <strong>Start Debugging</strong>. Make sure that AdventureWorks.Shopper is the startup project. When you run the app, the hub page appears.
</li></ol>
