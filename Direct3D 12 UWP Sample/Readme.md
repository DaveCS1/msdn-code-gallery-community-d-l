<p>DirectX 12 introduces the next version of Direct3D, the graphics API at the heart of DirectX.&nbsp; Direct3D is one of the most critical pieces of a game or game engine, and we've redesigned it to be faster and more efficient than ever before.&nbsp; Direct3D
 12 enabled reicher scenes, more object, and full utilization of modern GPU hardware.&nbsp; And it isn't just for high-end gaming PCs either - Direct3D works across all the Microsoft devices you care about.</p>
<p>What makes Direct3D 12 better?&nbsp; First and foremost, it provides a lower level of hardware abstraction than ever before, allowing games to significantly improve multi-thread scaling and CPU utilization.&nbsp; In addition, games will benefit from reduced
 GPU overhead via features such as descriptor tables and concise pipeline state objects.&nbsp; And that's not all - Direct3D 12 also introduces a set of new rendering pipeline features that will dramatically improve the efficiency of algorithms such as order-independent
 transparency, collision detection, and geometry culling.</p>
