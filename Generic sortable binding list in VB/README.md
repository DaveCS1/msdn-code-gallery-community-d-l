<br>
With this binding <br>
list you can make for instance LINQ queries sortable in a datagridview this can <br>
even be LINQ object queries as showed in the atached demo project <br>
you can <br>
now limit the result of a dataset with a LINQ query and bind it through the <br>
sortable bindinglist to make it sortable . <br>
<br>
I have seen numerous examples <br>
, some of them buggy and all of them in C# however this version is 100% stable ( <br>
used in a few of my production apps ) and is written in VB.Net 2010</p>
