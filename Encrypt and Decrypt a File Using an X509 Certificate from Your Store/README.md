## Description

<p>This sample demonstrates how to use an X509 certificate from your certificate file to encrypt a file, and how a recipient can use the same certificate in their store to deccrypt the file. This allows a central authority to distribute a certificate for file
 encryption that provides an ongoing means of encrypting and decrypting a shared file.</p>
