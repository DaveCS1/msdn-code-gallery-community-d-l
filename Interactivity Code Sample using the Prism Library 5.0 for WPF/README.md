## Description

<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p class="ppBodyText">The Interactivity QuickStart code sample demonstrates how views and view models can interact with the user using the Prism Library 5.0 for WPF. This includes interactions triggered from the view model and interactions fired by controls
 located in the view. To handle these different interactions the Prism library provides
<strong>InteractionRequests</strong> and <strong>InteractionRequestTriggers</strong>, along with the custom
<strong>InvokeCommandAction </strong>action. InvokeCommandAction is used to connect a trigger including events to a WPF command.</p>
<p class="ppBodyText">The QuickStart is composed of three tabs: Introduction, Interaction Requests, and InvokeCommandAction.</p>
<p class="ppBodyText">The <strong>Introduction</strong> tab, contains information about the purposes of the QuickStart. The
<strong>Interaction Requests</strong> tab, which includes four different scenarios, describes the usage of
<strong>InteractionRequests</strong> and <strong>InteractionRequestTriggers</strong> when a view model needs to interact with the user. Lastly, the
<strong>InvokeCommandAction</strong> tab, demonstrates how a command can be invoked in response to an event raised by a control in the view.</p>
