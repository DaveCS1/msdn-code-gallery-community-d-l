Normally one would add a reference to System.Windows.Forms to this project then use an import statement
to be able to write code as in MyDataGridView but instead I added System.Windows.Forms to Imported namespaces
on project->reference tab which now means we have this reference throught the project. Please note in C#
this is not an option so when looking at the C# version note the using statement for System.Windows.Forms.
