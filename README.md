# MSDN Code Gallery Microsoft Samples

Thank you for your support and contributions over the years to the MSDN Code Gallery. The MSDN Code Gallery has officially retired and all MSDN Code Gallery pages now redirect to the [new code samples experience](https://docs.microsoft.com/samples).

We have archived the most actively engaged code samples to public archive repositories on GitHub which can be accessed via the links below:

## Extract Sample Zip and/or Git Clone

If you are experiencing issues extracting and/or using Git Clone for samples, you may need to enable **Win32 Long Paths**. This setting can be enabled in the Local Group Policy Editor within Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Symstem\Filesystem. Alternatively, you could download the zip file and use WinRAR to extract the file.

## Contributing
