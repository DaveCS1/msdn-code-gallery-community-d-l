<p>Visual Studio is an IDE, or integrated development environment. Just like you use Microsoft Word to write documents, you'll use an IDE to create applications. In Visual Studio there's a toolbar along the top showing various options available to you. There's
 also a menu that provides another way to perform tasks in the IDE. (For example, instead of selecting
<strong>New Project</strong> from the <strong>Start</strong> page, you can use the menu and select
<strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>New Project</strong>.)</p>
<p>Click F5 to start debugging. F5 causes Visual Studio to start <a href="http://www.iis.net/learn/extensions/introduction-to-iis-express/iis-express-overview">
IIS Express</a> and run your web app. Visual Studio then launches a browser and opens the application's home page. Notice that the address bar of the browser says
<code>localhost:port#</code> and not something like <code>example.com</code>. That's because
<code>localhost</code> always points to your own local computer, which in this case is running the application you just built. When Visual Studio runs a web project, a random port is used for the web server. In the image below, the port number is 1234. When
 you run the application, you'll see a different port number.</p>
